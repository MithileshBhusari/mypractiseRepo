we will extend spring boot CRUD web application and implement pagination
and sorting operations using spring boot, thymeleaf, spring data JPA, Hibernate, and MySQL database.

pagination allows the users to see a small portion of data at a time (a page), and sorting allows the users to view the data in a more organized way.
Both paging and sorting help the users consume information more easily and conveniently.
